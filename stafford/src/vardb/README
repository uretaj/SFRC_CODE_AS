This directory houses utilities for converting various databases into
SQLite DBs. The `import` program converts Octopus VCF into the schema
outlined in `schema.sql`. The `dbnsfp` program imports a subset of
columns from the dbNSFP table, normalised into 6NF.

Import usage:
  import some.db sfrc99999 /path/to/octopus.vcf

dbNSFP usage:
  dbnsfp some.db /path/to/dbNSFP4.3a.zip
