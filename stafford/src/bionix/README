This directory contains all the expressions describing the individual sample
pipeline, as well as expressions for each sample in the cohort. The pipeline has
two main files – `multisample.nix` and `multisample-report.nix` – that
respectively contain the main pipeline and post processing for the report
generation. The `cohort/` directory contains cohort analysis.
