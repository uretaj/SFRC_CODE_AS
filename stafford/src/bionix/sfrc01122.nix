Send DNA only for WGS (will be #3!).\n\nRC Meeting 2022.01.20\nDiscussed S6 WGS report.\nNew Discussion: \nPatient responded to PARPi, but then progressed. Can't get a reversion on a BRCA2 deletion, so what happened? \nTMB for S6 is similar to S1 \nHR deficient now, did not have CHORD at time of S1. \nLots of new random mutations in S6, but not cosmic related genes. \nABL2 amplification - was previously on a big segment, but now is focal. Related to axon guidance. \nCh6 and Ch8 are much more fragmented... most chromosomes are more fragmented. This is due to time and general replication stress. The PRKDC mutation would work here (stabilisation of FRKs) \nPDX data looks good when treated with AZD5305. In the PDX sample for WGS the BRCA2 del is not quite there. Come back to that (for manuscript) \nCan't see an absolute cause for the PARPi resistance \n\nClare's meeting 2021.09.24\nS6 about 60-65% tumour: Gen to trial 2D and 3D and do WGS on snap frozen.\n\nClare's meeting notes 2021.06.03\nNo tumour in S5- very good. In complete remission. Is on second line PARPi \nRepeat PET in August (should be clear) \n\nRC Meeting notes 11.06.2020\nWait for update from Inger. Would need new tissue to try PDX again.\n27/5/20 - patient had responded well to chemo and there was no further tissue to collect . \n\nMeeting notes 04.06.2020\nPatient on Olaparib and after 3 courses of Cisplatin, responding really well. 3 more courses CT and continue with Olaparib. Plan: get PDX back on, trialling Cisplatin and PARPi. Or other treatments +/- PARPi. \nHolly to check previous thoughts on possible drugs and send to Olga (revisit in 2 weeks) ";
