Low tumour purity (was macrodissected) = 0.27 \nMUC4 in mesothelioma - there are 5 in this case - only 1 relevant? \nhttps://jitc.bmj.com/content/jitc/8/1/e000713.full.pdf \nSomatic sorted by frequency - no Clinvar hits \nNo focal amplifications or deletions \n\nRC Meeting 2021.04.01\nCome back to WES report when Jocelyn is back.\n\nRC Meeting 2021.03.18\nCopy number analysis on WES report needs work. Come back to this.\n\n2021.01.28\nPlan: Make DNA - see what quantity I get (WGS/WES/TSO500).  \nUpdate: Have 97 ng/ul DNA - over 4 Âµg.
