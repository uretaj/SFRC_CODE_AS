We do have mince available, for some reason this sample has not been transplanted yet. Would you like to attempt a PDX? Should the treating clinician be made aware that we do not have any tumour in our fresh sample? \n\nCS:  Yes - please attempt a PDX asap \nI will let med onc know that we have no tumour in our blocks but that we will wait to see if we get a PDX. \n\nClare sample meeting 21.12.2023\nPlan on fresh tissue S2: Both OCT and FFPE have no tumour. There is one vial of snap frozen available, we could attempt another OCT but is it worth it? \nCS: DID WE PUT MINCE INTO MICE? YES, DO AN OCT H+E TO SEE IF TUMOR PRESENT. I HAVE EMAILED THE MED ONC RE THERE IS LIKELY NO TUMOUR. THERE ARE OTHER HITS FROM THE ORIGINAL ANALYSES SO THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THOSE UP. \n\nEmails from Clare 17.11.2023 \nPatient having surgery at Epworth Freemasons this Friday evening, sample post lenvatinib, hoping to do a second WGS. Anthony to take MACS buffer and collect, Ratana to process Saturday.\n\nBROCA meeting with Clare 15.10.2021\nOrganise BROCA on same sample as WGS (S1)\n\nRC Meeting 10.06.2021\nDiscussed findings from RNAseq data to complement WGS (DNA only) data.\nThere's interesting focal amps on 12 that don't seem to be mentioned \nNo changes needed to existing Stafford Report.  \nTMB calculated by WEHI is usually higher than UMCCR, haplotype threshold differences. Can do internal validation. \n\n15.03.2021\nMade new OCT blocks to review and make RNA for Sean's lab to do transcriptome analysis.\n\nWhen we have both WGS and RNASeq, we can then line these cases up for Proteomics with Roger Reddell - he would prefer a lot of cases to a few. We need 40um (eg 4 x 10 um) - so have a think about which cases we could put forward for that! \n\nRC Meeting 18.02.2021\nTo make RNA and send to Sean's lab for RNAseq to compare with large cancer dataset\n\nRC Meeting 10.12.2020\nERBB2 >6 copies would be amplified. These 4 copies line up with the equivocal HER2 IHC.\nKRAS amp - is a large region, not focal amplification? - could get onto BGB282 MEKi trial ";
